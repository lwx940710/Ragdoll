Description:
 
1. Press on the torso and drag to move the entire paper doll. All other parts will remain relatively static to the torso. 
2. Press on arms, hands and feet and drag to rotate them within degree limits.
3. Press on legs and drag to scale and rotate them at the same time. No limit for maximum length of legs.
4. Body parts may move a little off their attaching points while rotating because of round-off problems during math computing.
5. Please try to drag body parts slowly.


Enhancements:

1. Have background image for the paper doll and it changes when you move the paper doll.
2. Have timeline with 3 buttons: playback, add frame, clear all. The timeline only goes between poses.
